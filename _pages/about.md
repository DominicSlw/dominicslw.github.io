I am an MIIS Student at [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) (LTI), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by Prof. [Chenyan Xiong](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/). I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC) in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Mathematics (with [Highest Honors](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/awards/undergraduate-scholarships-awards/bronze-tablet-award)). During my undergraduate, I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) at [Data Mining Group](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/)(DMG). 

My research interests are on the intersection of text mining, graph mining, and multimodal information retrieval. My primary goal is to enhance NLP models by effectively leveraging heterogeneous external knowledge (text corpus, web tables, knowledge graphs) to generate coherent and informative answers. Currently, I am focusing on utilizing large language models to solve challenging domain-specific tasks such as healthcare agent and retrieval-augmented chest report generation.

Apart from academic aspirations, I am a huge fan of acoustic guitar 🎸 and basketball 🏀. I have been practicing both for almost ten years. If you are going to visit CMU, please let me sing 🎤 for you with my guitar (I wish I had more time learning new songs 🎶 recently).
