I am an MIIS Student at [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) (LTI), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by Prof. [Chenyan Xiong](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/). I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC) in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Mathematics (with [Highest Honors](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/awards/undergraduate-scholarships-awards/bronze-tablet-award)). During my undergraduate, I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) at [Data Mining Group](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/)(DMG). 

My research interests are on the intersection of text mining, graph mining, and multimodal information retrieval. My primary goal is to develop multimodal retrieval-augmented language models for effective, interactive, and grounded information access in general and special domains. Currently, I am focusing on utilizing large language models to solve challenging domain-specific tasks such as healthcare agent and retrieval-augmented chest report generation.

Apart from academic aspirations, I am a huge fan of acoustic guitar 🎸 and basketball 🏀. I have been practicing both for almost ten years. If you are going to visit CMU, please let me sing 🎤 for you with my guitar (I wish I had more time learning new songs 🎶 recently).
